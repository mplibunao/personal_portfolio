# personal_portfolio
Second FreeCodeCamp Basic Front End Development Project

Link to the Project Spec: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage



I originally made this project as well as some of the initial projects in Codepen.io since that's where FreeCodeCamp recommends their campers do their work for fast and easy set-up.

Anyway I've transitioned to GitHub after a while just so I can get used to a development environment much closer to the ones in the real world where you import and fix your own dependencies and such. But since I was in a hurry I wasn't able to export this and some of the projects to Git.

Anyway I'm doing it now so I can link all my projects here in my portfolio as well.
I'll probably be making a lot of changes since the original project wasn't really that good. Mind you this was the 2nd project. I've done close to 10 projects now so there is some improvement. lol. Also since I didn't have any projects to link there and then I kinda just skipped some finishing touches since I knew I would be going back to it anyway. In hindsight I should have worked on it more because I didn't come back to it early enough. Haha.



Anyway, same User Stories:
- User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

- User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

- User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

- User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
